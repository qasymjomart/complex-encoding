## COMPLEX ENCODING CODE FILES GUIDE


  * The code files in the following folders are written in MATLAB and should be opened using MATLAB
  * If you want to test a classifier, go to a classifier folder, use and run ".mlx" extension file; other files are accompanying function files
  * If you want to see the file implementing complex encoding, go to Complex-Encoding folder and find 'CEncoding.m' file, and to see the mapping function that 
  converts real-valued variables into complex-encoded variable, find 'CMapping.m' file
